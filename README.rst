OADDS is an Online Anomaly Detection engine for Data Streams capable of processing instances (data points) in a single-pass and unsupervised fashion. It uses the micro-clusters data structure presented in [DenStream].  

The algorithm can be used to monitor **Telemetry** data (data streams) and raise alarms. Each instance is represented in the euclidean space as a **1 x F** data point, where F is the number of features representing the measurements.
